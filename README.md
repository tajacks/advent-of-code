Under each of the days in the appropriate years package, there is a utility class that does the bulk

:new_moon: = 0/2 Stars Achieved
:last_quarter_moon: = 1/2 Stars Achieved
:full_moon: = 2/2 Stars Achieved

| Year | Language | Days Completed                                                                                                                  |
